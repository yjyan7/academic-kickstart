Bachelor and MSc project

- The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is the highest plateau and one of the largest plateaus on the Earth with an average altitude of >4000m and occupying ~2.5 million km2.

- The rapid uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has resulted in rapid and continuous specification and diversification for plants. Being a center of biodiversity hotspots, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau provides habitats for ~9000 vascular plants,of which ~18% are endemic to this area.

- In this project, I 
  - compiled distribution datasets of ~8000 vascular plants on the Tibetan Plateau. 
  - analyzed the factors determining the species and phylogenetic diversity patterns. 
  -	evaluated the impact of future climate change on the distribution of ~1000 endemic seed plants in this region and assessed the effectiveness of current nature reserve system.
