2018 onwards

Malpighiaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Malpighiales. It comprises about 73 genera and 1315 species, all of which are native to the tropics and subtropics. About 80% of the genera and 90% of the species occur in the New World.

In this project, I 

- Performed DNA extraction for >100 species
- Arranged genome skimming sequencing for >400 samples
- Compiled a distribution dataset for c. 900 species
- Performed biogeographic analysis.
