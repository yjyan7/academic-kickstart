*Franklinia alatamaha* Bartr. ex Marshall (the Franklin tree) is an attractive and iconic species in the Theaceae family. Although loved by many gardeners, it went extinct in the wild in 1800s. Yet the main causes of its extinction are still debated. Interestingly, its close relative, *Gordonia lasianthus* (L.) Ellis,
which is morphologically very similar and shares the same habitat, remains common in the wild.

In this project, I attempt to explore the genomic basis of the extinction.

I 
- Assembled a high quality reference genome of both species using Nanopore + Illumina sequencing
- Collected samples of both species from various gardens, herbarium, and traved in southeastern US for three weeks
- Resequenced the genomes of a dozens of individuals
