abstract: Large-scale patterns of species richness and the underlying mechanisms regulating
  these patterns have long been the central issues in biogeography and macroecology.
  Phylogenetic community structure is a result of combined effects of contemporary
  ecological interactions, environmental filtering, and evolutionary history, and
  it links community ecology with biogeography and trait evolution. The Qinghai-Tibetan
  Plateau provides a good opportunity to test the influence of contemporary climate
  on shaping species richness because of its unique geological history, cold climate,
  and high biodiversity. In this study, based on high-resolution distributions of
  Ëœ9000 vascular plant species, we explored how species richness and phylogenetic
  structure of vascular plants correlate with climates on the highest (and species
  rich) plateau on the Earth. The results showed that most of the vascular plants
  were distributed on the eastern part of the plateau; there was a strong association
  between species richness and climate, even after the effects of habitat heterogeneity
  were controlled. However, the responses of richness to climate remarkably depended
  on life-forms. Richness of woody plants showed stronger climatic associations than
  that of herbaceous plants; energy and water availability together regulated richness
  pattern of woody plants; whereas water availability predominantly regulated richness
  pattern of herbaceous plants. The phylogenetic structure of vascular species clustered
  in most areas of the plateau, suggesting that rapid speciation and environment filtering
  dominated the assembly of communities on the plateau. We further propose that biodiversity
  conservation in this area should better take into account ecological features for
  different life-forms and phylogenetic lineages.
