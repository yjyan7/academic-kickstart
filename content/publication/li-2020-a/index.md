abstract: China is rich in macrofungal biodiversity. However, many species have been
  threatened in recent years by human activity and climate change. Red list assessment
  is the first step towards species con-servation. To protect this group of fungi,
  the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China and the
  Chinese Academy of Sciences性launchedthe Red List Assessment of Macrofungi in China
  in 2016. A reasonable assessment largely relies样on the sufficient information of
  species' geographic information, population numbers and sizes and population dynamics,
  which is lacked in most of macrofungal species. It is therefore necessary to employ
  new approaches to find and utilize more information for the assessment. Among the
  assessed species, Ophiocordyceps sinensis, which is an edible and medicinal fungus
  endemic to the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding regions, has relatively abundant
  information. This species gained attention worldwide due to its obvious economic
  value and its importance to local societies. A species distribution modeling has
  also been an important component of its red list assessment. Here, we call on a
  previous study that aimed to predict the current potential distribution and to project
  the future distribution of Ophiocordyceps sinensis, and then we discuss how this
  modeling method can be employed in red list assessments to predict the current potential
  distribution and the range shifts of other macrofungal species in response to climate
  change. Challenges of using the model and possible solutions are also discussed.
  The species distribution modeling method is considered to have great potential for
  red list assessments and the subsequent conservation of macrofungi.
