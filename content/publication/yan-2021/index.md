abstract: 'The tea family (Theaceae) has a highly unusual amphi-Pacific disjunct distribution:
  most extant species in the family are restricted to subtropical evergreen broadleaf
  forests in East Asia, while a handful of species occur exclusively in the subtropical
  and tropical Americas. Here we used an approach that integrates the rich fossil
  evidence of this group with phylogenies in biogeographic analysis to study the processes
  behind this distribution pattern. We first combined genome-skimming sequencing with
  existing molecular data to build a robust species-level phylogeny for c.140 Theaceae
  species, resolving most important unclarified relationships. We then developed an
  empirical Bayesian method to incorporate distribution evidence from fossil specimens
  into historical biogeographic analyses and used this method to account for the spatiotemporal
  history of Theaceae fossils. We compared our method with an alternative Bayesian
  approach and show that it provides consistent results while significantly reduces
  computational demands which allows analyses of much larger datasets. Our analyses
  revealed a circumboreal distribution of the family from the early Cenozoic to the
  Miocene and inferred repeated expansions and retractions of the modelled distribution
  in the Northern Hemisphere, suggesting that the current Theaceae distribution could
  be the remnant of a larger continuous distribution associated with the boreotropical
  forest that has been hypothesized to occupy most of the northern latitudes in the
  early Cenozoic. These results contradict with studies that only considered current
  species distributions and showcase the necessity of integrating fossil and molecular
  data in phylogeny-based parametric biogeographic models to improve the reliability
  of inferred biogeographical events.'
