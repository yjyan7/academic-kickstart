Hello! Welcome to my research site! 

I am an evolutionary macroecologist with a broad interest in biogeography, phylogenomics, and biodiversity patterns under climate change. 

I am now working as a HUH postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard University Herbaria, studying the diversification and extinction of the tea family (Theaceae). I hope to provide insights for the future of the group by uncovering the past history. 

Please explore this site to learn more about my research interests and publications. If you have further questions or are intersted in collaborating, please contact me: yujingyan@fas.harvard.edu
